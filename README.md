# Anti K-pop Spammers Filterlist for Twitter
This list is a fork of [DandelionSprout's AntiKpopSpammersTwitter](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt) updated with more K-pop artists, bands and related stuff.

We are trying to remove all the K-poppers spam from the trending page :)

To add this filter to your adblocker, follow the instructions on the wiki [here](https://github.com/Cinnamon-Unltd/Anti-Kpop-Spammers-Filterlist-for-Twitter/wiki/How-to-Install)

Disclaimer: We just don't want K-Pop in random trending hashtags and in posts that have nothing to do with K-Pop. We have nothing personal against K-Pop.
